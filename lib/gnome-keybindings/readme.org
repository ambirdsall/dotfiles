#+title: Syncing keybindings for GNOME and PaperWM

It is a little silly to have to go through such a song and dance to programmatically sync
some keybinding settings, but this is what happens when settings aren't managed in plain
text files. Ah, me.

* The contents of this directory were programmatically generated
Odds are good that if you're reading this
1) you're me; or at least
2) you have installed the dotfiles repo these are tracked in,
but nevertheless I slapped a ~mkdir -p~ in front of the following command just in case you,
dear reader, want to copy-paste this from a different computer. To (re)create keybinding
dumps like those in this directory, run the following:
#+begin_src shell :results none
mkdir -p ~/lib/gnome-keybindings
for kbs in $(gsettings list-schemas | rg -S keybindings); do
  dconf dump $(echo "/$kbs/" | sed "s_\._/_g") > ~/lib/gnome-keybindings/$kbs
done

for ext in $(dconf list /org/gnome/shell/extensions/); do
  ext_name=$(echo $ext | tr -d /)
  ext_kbs="$(dconf dump /org/gnome/shell/extensions/$ext_name/keybindings/)"
  if [ $(echo $ext_kbs | wc -l) -gt 1 ]; then
    echo $ext_kbs > ~/lib/gnome-keybindings/org.gnome.shell.extensions.$ext_name.keybindings
  fi
done
#+end_src

* To install these keybindings in another computer
Each filename here maps to its corresponding schema/namespace in gsettings and dconf
because life is too short to do manual computer work when you don't have to:
#+begin_src shell :results none
for kbs in $(ls | grep -v readme); do
  cat $kbs | dconf load $(echo "/$kbs/" | sed "s_\._/_g")
done
#+end_src
