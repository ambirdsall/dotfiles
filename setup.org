#+title: How to setup a computer on different operating systems

* MacOS
** Install homebrew
** TODO create =~/lib/brew-deps= and =~/sbin/macos-install=
** Install Karabiner Elements
*** TODO export karabiner settings to JSON, track with dotfiles, and document import

** Install hammerspoon

* linux
** distro-specific setup
*** arch
**** start by installing endeavourOS sway edition rather than vanilla arch
This isn't a must-do, just a convenience. EOS has nice defaults, many of which I have
adopted into these dotfiles, and is a much simpler installation process.

**** TODO tweak settings in =/etc/pacman.conf=
parallelism, etc

**** run ~~/sbin/arch-install~

**** don't forget ~systemctl reboot~

*** fedora
**** tweak dnf settings
Add the following lines to =/etc/dnf/dnf.conf=:
#+begin_src conf
defaultyes=True
max_parallel_downloads=15
fastestmirror=True
#+end_src

**** enable rpmfusion
Double-check that the command and urls are the same at [[https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration#Command_Line_Setup_using_rpm][the rpmfusion website]], and then run
the following command:
#+begin_src shell
sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
#+end_src

**** run =~/sbin/fedora-install=
If you are on x86, rather than ARM, add the ~--with-copr~ flag to the script invocation.

* Securely migrating the contents of a home directory
To create an encrypted tarball of the directory, run:
#+begin_src shell
tar -czf - * | openssl enc -e -aes256 -out secured.tar.gz
#+end_src

To decrypt and extract into a subdirectory (either to test or to unpackage the downloaded tarball):
#+begin_src shell
openssl enc -d -aes256 -in secured.tar.gz | tar xz -C tmphome
#+end_src

If everything in there is in order, you can move everything to the ~$HOME~ toplevel:
#+begin_src shell
rsync --recursive \
      --verbose \
      --backup --suffix=.installed.orig \
      tmphome/ $HOME/
rm -r tmphome
#+end_src
