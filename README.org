#+TITLE: dotfiles
These are my linux configuration files. They're tracked in a git repository separate from the
working tree, which is just my home directory; this replaces an ongoing symlink song and dance for a
little upfront setup effort, which frankly is a pretty great tradeoff.
* to install on a new computer
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone --separate-git-dir=$HOME/.dots https://github.com/ambirdsall/dots.git tmpdotfiles
  rsync --recursive --verbose --exclude '.git' tmpdotfiles/ $HOME/
  rm -r tmpdotfiles
#+END_SRC
* managing this git directory
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd
  dots config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
#+END_SRC

The =dots= command is defined in the =~/aliases.zsh= file (at the time of writing) as
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dots () {
  if [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; then
    git --git-dir=$HOME/.dots/ --work-tree=$HOME ${@}
  else
    git --git-dir=$HOME/.dots/ --work-tree=$HOME status
  fi
}
#+END_SRC sh
So it's simply a wrapper for ~git~, but if you don't give any subcommand, it just gives you the
status, which is so much more useful as a default that honestly, I'm not sure why it's not the
official ~git~ behavior.
